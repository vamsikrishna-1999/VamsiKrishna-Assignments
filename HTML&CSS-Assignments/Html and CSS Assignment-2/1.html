            <p>The Mercedes-Benz is a thoroughbred racing car built by Mercedes and AMG for homologation requirements imposed by the FIA GT Championship in 1997. A limited edition street version of the Mercedes CLK GTR was in fact necessary in order to be allowed on the track.

                However, the buyers of this 320-km/h super sports car did not get the V12 engine (5986 cc displacement, 631 HP) of the race car derived from the M 120 with dry-sump lubrication and other optimizations such as titanium connecting rods and valves. Instead, the production vehicle was equipped with a 6.9-litre V12 series engine of type M 120 rated at 612 hp.
                
                Even though the FIA GT1 class was cancelled for 1999, Mercedes was obliged to finally deliver the required 25 road cars according to the rules of the competition. In the end, 26 cars were made in total by AMG at the Affalterbach factory between winter of 1998 and summer of 1999 and only 6 of them were roadsters. So, the most exclusive limited production Mercedes-Benz is the CLK GTR Roadster.

                The roadster version is slightly different from the coupe version. The engine cover was redesigned and, behind the seats, there are two integrated roll-bars, that have a double role for safety and for increasing the rigidity of the body. The front grille is different from the coupe, having the Mercedes star in it instead of the placing above the bonnet.When the FIA GT Championship was founded in 1997 as the successor to the BPR Global GT Series, Mercedes-Benz competed with the new CLK-GTR racing touring car. The vehicle was developed, built and ultimately used in the championship together with motorsport partner AMG.

                According to the FIA (Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile) regulations, the car also had to be built as a production vehicle at a minimum quantity. Only a very limited edition of 25 left hand drive copies of the highly exclusive street-legal Mercedes CLK GTR AMG (C 297) left the factory, with an additional RHD example tailored for the Sultan of Brunei. As a result, 26 vehicles were built, of which 20 were Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR Coupes.

                The 6.9-liter V12 engine tuned by Ilmor Engineering who increase the displacement from 6.0 litre to 6.9 litre made a whopping 612 hp and 775 Nm of torque, while top speed was rated at 320 km/h. The Benz sprinted from 0 to 100 in 3.8 seconds.

The CLK GTR was the most expensive production car ever built at the time with a price of 1,547,620 USD.

                The supercharged 5.4-litre AMG V8 engine is rated at 660 HP. The SLR Stirling Moss could attain a top speed of 350 km/h  with acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h achieved in 3 seconds. The car is approximately 200 kg (441 lb) lighter than the regular model due to carbon fibre construction and speedster styling.
